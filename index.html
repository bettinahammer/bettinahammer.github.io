        Originally from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont,
        I am an MPP student at the University of Chicago
        Harris School of Public Policy ('23).
        Broadly, Iâ€™m interested in how individuals process and use information
        to understand their context and make decisions.
        Before starting my degree, I was an Emmanuel Roman Research Fellow at
        <a href="https://surgoventures.org/">Surgo Ventures</a>,
        where I worked on a direct-to-consumer digital COVID-19 symptom checker
        in Mali, Malawi, and Uganda.
        I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Chicago in 2020
        with a B.A. in Sociology and a minor in Arabic Language.
