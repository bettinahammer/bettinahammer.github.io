        Originally from the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont,
        I am an MPP ‘23 student at the University of Chicago
        Harris School of Public Policy.
        Broadly, I’m interested in how individuals process and use information
        to understand their context and make decisions.
        Before starting my degree, I was an Emmanuel Roman Research Fellow at
        <a href="https://surgoventures.org/">Surgo Ventures</a>,
        where I worked on a direct-to-consumer digital COVID-19 symptom checker
        in Mali, Malawi, and Uganda.
        I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Chicago in 2020
        with a B.A. in Sociology and a minor in Arabic Language.
